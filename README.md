  Building a JAMstack Blog using Gatsby, Contentful, and Netlify
</h1>


In this tutorial, we will create a blazing fast blog website hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) on the client and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) as our headless CMS, which will serve our content. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a fully functional blog site to share with the world! 

This tutorial uses [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), which is a modern web development architecture based on client-size **J**avaScript, reusable **A**PIs, and prebuilt **M**arkup. This architecture allows us to create blazing fast, secure, dynamic apps that are served without web servers.

In this repository, you will find two folders: [gatsby-tutorial-starter-template](https://github.com/morganrmarie/jamstack-tutorial-template/tree/updating-docs/gatsby-tutorial-starter-template) and [gatsby-tutorial-final](https://github.com/morganrmarie/jamstack-tutorial-template/tree/updating-docs/gatsby-tutorial-final). If you're following along with this YouTube video, start with the starter template. If you're familiar with JAMstack or don't want to go through the tutorial, go ahead and use the final. 

## What You Will Be Creating

After completing this tutorial, you'll finish up with a website that hopefully looks like this. If it doesn't, DM me.

## Requirements
This tutorial has no technical requirements, but there are a few things I would recommend reviewing before getting started. Having a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will help you with this tutorial. If you're not familiar with React, take a look at their documentation, review, and you should be good to follow along.

## Setup and Installation
You're going to need to have Node.js and Gatsby installed on your machine. I would recommend using Homebrew. Initial setup now will save you many headaches later. To setup Gatsby on your machine, you can follow Gatsby's docs [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) or head over to my YouTube channel for a video on how to set it up.
